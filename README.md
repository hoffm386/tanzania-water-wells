This README.pdf file will serve as a roadmap to this repository. The repository is open and available to the public.

Directories and files to be aware of:

1. An “environment.yml” file that contains the packages necessary to running the executables

2. An src/ directory that contains a .py module
  a. In the root directory of this folder on your local machine, in your terminal please run 'pip install -e .' to allow the notebooks to access our functions. This will run our 'setup.py' file in the root directory

2. A notebooks directory that contains three Jupyter notebooks
  a. A data exploration notebook
  b. A modeling notebook, containing five models
  c. A presentation notebook, containing our final report and model 

3. A data/ directory containing three data files
  a. Due to GitHub upload restrictions, these are included as .gitignore files. They are, in brief:
    i.Training set target labels
    ii.Training set features
    iii.Test set features
    
4. A one-page .pdf memo written summarizing the models’ results, written for non-technical stakeholders

5. An “Executive Summary” slideshow PDF available as “presentation.pdf”

The data files described above can be found on https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/7/pump-it-up-data-mining-the-water-table/data/​. An account setup is required for download.

Methodology
  We performed a thorough EDA of the dataset, and built several models to detectif a water is in need of repairs. We tried 5 different classification models, settling on a Random Forest Classifier as the best performer. It had a higher overall F1 Score, aswell as the best recall for the 'Needs Repair' category. Higher recall means fewer False Negatives - we believe that this is the best metric by which to evaluate the performanceof the model; A well needing repairs yet being labeled as “Functional” could have devastating effects to a local community. Conversely, a well erroneously labeled “Needs Repair” would not have nearly as harmful an effect.

Result Metrics
Our random forest classifier model had an 82% accuracy overall, with an F1-Score for the True “Functional” label of 84% and 79% for the True “Needs Repair”label. The metric best for our business case, True “Needs Repair” Recall, performed theworst, unfortunately, at 77%. While this is still a good predictive mode, if given moretime we would like to perform more feature engineering to increase this recall score.
